# minecraft-auto-pause
The Minecraft Auto-Pause Script is a Bash script designed to manage the state of your Minecraft server based on player activity. This script monitors the number of connected players and automatically pauses the server if no players are active for a specified timeout duration. It also allows for resuming the server when players reconnect.
